After launching [Job Description AI - Professional job description generator with few clicks](https://jobdescription.ai) on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/job-description-ai), I spent the following three weeks fixing bugs and adding features requested by users to improve the service.

I have created a notion page for releases and included a link inside the portal to present the progress to regular users, but how do I inform everyone?

I decided to send my first email update to all registered users informing them about the progress in the last three weeks.

## The context
1. I use [Hupspot](https://www.hubspot.com) to send up to 2000 per month for free.
2. I started the email by thanking everyone for their time trying the service. I also offered users to delete their account if they do not use it anymore (privacy).
3. Listing a screenshot of each new feature, here is a [link to the email](https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/content/41619626767?portalId=9240276&_preview=true&cacheBust=0&preview_key=KgkNcFjc&from_buffer=false).

## Metrics after 24 hours

Open rate: 20.5%

Unsubscribed: 1%

Bounced: 0.54%

Spam report: 0%

Click rate: 0.8%

Open on desktop: 72%

Open on mobile: 28%

Click rate on desktop: 67%

Click rate on mobile: 33%

## Low click rate!
The reasons of the low click rate:

- I didn't include a CTA.
- Only the logo had a link to the website. The feature images didn't.


## How I would improve next time?
- Add call to action.
